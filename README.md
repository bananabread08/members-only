# Project: Members Only

## Features and Functionalites

A Simple Clubhouse Web App. Write Posts/Messages and only exclusive members can see these.

- Create an authenticated account.
- Visit your Profile and all your posts.
- Visit the Home Page to see every post from all users.
- Become a member by sending the correct secret code. Type "member" to become one.

## Objectives and Outcomes

This is my 3rd Full Stack app made using Node/Express + MongoDB.

Some of the hurdles along the way:

1. I honestly thought PassportJS was so complicated, but it turned out to be simple. Trying to understand authentication especially about session is quite fascinating and a good learning experience.

2. I still got a hard time remembering all the node/express backend syntax like the validation, the GET, POST, etc. methods. Overall, a good practice of backend stuff.

3. I tried to implement and use TailwindCSS here. It's my first time using it and it's exciting to use. I'll try to use it from now on.

## Usage / Running the Project Locally.

1. Clone the repository. (git clone ...)
2. Install/Update node_modules in the project directory. (npm install)
3. Run the app. (npm run devstart)

## Development

Made with mainly:

- NodeJS
- Express JS
- MongoDB as Database.
- PassportJS for Authentication
- Pug as view engine
